This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration and its solution.  The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected code.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` should be `i < arr.length` to avoid accessing the non-existent element at index 5 in an array of size 5. This example highlights the importance of careful loop boundary checks when working with arrays in Java.
